                <h2>Who am I? </h2>
                <p>Hi assalamualaikum ! My name is Nur Alma Qistina Binti Zamri, and I am 20 years old. I was born on April 21, 2004, in the peaceful state of Perak, Malaysia. Although I started my life there, I spent most of my growing-up years in Shah Alam, Selangor, a place that holds many wonderful memories for me.</p>

                <h2>What's next?</h2>
                <p>I developed a deep love for stories, especially ones filled with mysteries. That’s why Detective Conan has always been one of my favorite shows. I love following the clever plots and figuring out the twists and turns alongside the characters. On days when I want to relax, I enjoy watching Studio Ghibli movies. Their magical worlds, beautiful animation, and life lessons always inspire and peaceful me.</p>

                    <p>During my school years, my favorite subject was history. I’ve always found it fascinating to learn about past events and how they shaped the world we live in today. I also developed a love for English, thanks to my amazing teacher, Teacher Hanisah. She made learning the language enjoyable, and her passion for teaching truly inspired me.</p>

                <h2>What I wish for?</h2>
                <p>My biggest ambition is to become a successful and wealthy woman. I want to provide for my family and be able to buy my mother anything she wishes for. I dream of traveling with her, experiencing new places together, and most importantly, performing Hajj with her one day. To me, my mother is the most important person in my life. No matter where I go or what I do, I will always need her dua's, and I want to make her proud in everything I do.</p>
